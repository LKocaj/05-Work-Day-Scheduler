# Work-Day-Scheduler

## About the Project

This is a simple browser app that allows people to create events throughout their workday in order to stay organized. The hours range from 9 to 5 to emulate the average workday. When you add an event and press save, the data you entered should remain upon page refresh thanks to local storage. The purpose of the project was to increase efficiency by breaking down a busy day into smaller parts.
